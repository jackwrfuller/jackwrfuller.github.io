I am a Digital Projects Officer at the Mark Agency with a passion for mathematics and computing, I excel at managing front-end digital projects that require both technical expertise and strong leadership skills. With a first-class honours degree in Mathematical Statistics and currently pursuing a Master of Computing, I have a deep understanding of the quantitative underpinnings of technology.

My thesis focused on the mathematical properties of a machine learning model called random forests, giving me hands-on experience in applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world problems. I bring this same attention to detail and analytical rigor to every project I undertake, ensuring that they are delivered on time, on budget, and to the highest quality standards. Combining my strong quantitative background with my ability to manage people and projects, I am committed to achieving excellence in everything I do.

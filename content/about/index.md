Mathematician by training, software engineer by trade.

I am driven by an insatiable curiosity of the world, trying to learn new things every day. 

I love solving problems - any problems will do, but the more technical, the better.

A complete computer nerd that wishes he was a professional tennis player.

An amateur chess tragic holding on to the belief he may yet one day reach master strength

Whisky enthusiast - neat, with a splash of water, and smokier than a peat oven.

I am always keen to chat with new people. If you are feeling gregarious, drop me an email at [hi@jackwrfuller.au](mailto:hi@jackwrfuller.au)

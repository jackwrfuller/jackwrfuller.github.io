I am a project manager with a passion for mathematics and computing and excel at managing digital projects that require both technical expertise and strong management skills. I have a first-class honours degree in mathematical statistics and am currently pursuing a computer science masters, which gives me a deep understanding of the quantitative underpinnings of technology.

My thesis was focused on the mathematical properties of a machine learning model called random forests, giving me hands-on experience in applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world problems. I bring this same attention to detail and analytical rigor to every project I undertake, ensuring that they are delivered on time, on budget, and to the highest quality standards. Combining my strong quantitative background with my ability to manage people and projects, I am committed to achieving excellence in everything I do.

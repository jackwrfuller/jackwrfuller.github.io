## Into the deepend

As part of my journey to become an expert engineer, I am currently enrolled in a Masters of Computing at the ANU which I attend remotely. The first course I took had a major group assignment that tasked us to build in Java - using the JavaFX engine - the (perhaps) little-known board game [*Blue Lagoon*](https://blueorangegames.eu/en/games/blue-lagoon/) by Reiner Knizia. The main purpose of this project was to cut our teeth on building larger scale projects involving multiple contributors while honing our object-oriented skills. Ironically, and not surprising at all to anyone who has done a university group assignment, my group members all went completely MIA very quickly. In short, I was left to make this game all by myself. While I have done a good deal of programming throughout my undergraduate years and on a hobbyist level, this was my first time building and persevering with a major project like this. And boy, did I learn some lessons.

As this was by no means my first time writing code, I was already familiar with [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law):

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law. 

However, what I didn't realise at the time and perhaps what I should've known, was that this law applies in its own way to software complexity. Oh how easy it is to visual your system in your head! It should be simple right? What I quickly realised was that once I got around to implementing some feature or another, three dependencies sprung up like hydras. I was naively falling  afoul of [Murphy's Fourth Corollary](https://zira.home.xs4all.nl/murphy.html):

> Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first.

Furthermore, given my heretofore limited experience in software architecture, the business logic twisted, turned, and backflipped as my OO ability improved. Code refactoring was a common occurance, as my understanding of how to architect start to gain momentum. This was made tougher by the fact I was attempting to work on a 3 person job alone, without external validation to keep me in check. I often felt like I was hacking my way through CGP Grey's Forest of All Knowledge, desperately lost in tangent after tangent. 

Well, after all that wandering I have something to show for it: a game! Though unfortunately, not really. Due to time constraints (I work full-time) I was unable to fully flesh out the project and deliver a working game, at least for the moment. I made enough progress that I am proud of what I accomplished, and want to move on. Thus I felt comfortable sharing what I have made, regardless of how undercooked it is. The skills I have developed along the way will propel me to bigger and better projects. 

In this article I want to share some of the learnings I took

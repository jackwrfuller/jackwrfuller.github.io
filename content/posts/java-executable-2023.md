In my university course this semester, I was tasked with creating a JavaFX game. As this was my first big project, this was a difficult but rewarding challenge where I learned so much. While I go into more detail about the project [here](https://jackwrfuller.github.io/projects/blue-lagoon), I wanted to share some of the smaller things I learned while embarking on this journey so that one day someone out there will not have to spend the same ridiculous hours troubleshooting and furiously googling that I did.  

As it turned out, one of the most surprising tasks in terms of its difficulty was turning the JavaFX game first into a jar file, and then an executable. Early on in the project, I thought it would be cool to turn the game into a standalone application - you know, like a proper game. Since I am developing on a Windows machine, this was a .exe file. I thought to myself that it would be a matter of pressing some button in IntelliJ (my IDE). Oh boy, how wrong I was. So, in the hope to save some poor soul the tribulations I did, I want to share how to turn a JavaFX project in IntelliJ into an exe file. 

# What you will need
To complete this task (at least the way I do it), you will need:
- IntelliJ
- JavaFX
- Launch4J
